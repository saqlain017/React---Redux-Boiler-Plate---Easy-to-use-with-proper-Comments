# React + Vite + react-redux

This boiler plate will help you to understand that how to manage states using react-redux.
In this boiler plate, I have taken a basic example of increment and decrement counter

Given basic use of createSlice, configureStore, useDispatch, useSelector, reducers, actions.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
